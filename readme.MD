#Web Programming Final Project

This was for my web programming class in Spring 2019.
In this project, we used PHP to create a website where users can create accounts and submit discussions to a forum.
It was modeled after Reddit, except with a specific focus. 
The technology used in the website is PHP to create the search function, log in/sign in, as well as the collection of data.
HTML and CSS were used to create the layout of the website.

This project was a group effort, and I was in charge of the layout, as well as the sign up/login and the display of data from our text documents that we used.
In reality, this project would not be deployed with text documents as our storage device. Instead we would connect a database
and hold our user data and information in separate tables.
